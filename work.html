		<p>I am a junior studying at the University of Michigan. I am a part of the BSI program at the School of Information, with a minor in the Ross school of Business.</p>
		<p>At school I am a part of the Chi Omega Sorority, as well as the Michigan Daily Audience engagement team, the Wolverine Support Network Design team, and Business Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>As a member of these clubs I spend a lot of my time focusing on Social Media and design. I specifically chose these because I want to have a career in UX Design, and these clubs
            are able to provide me with some of the experience that I will need in the future. </p>
